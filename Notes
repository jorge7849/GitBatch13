Architecture of git

3-stage architecture working directory, staging area,repo

working directory--------->>>>>>


gitproject1---> pom,src,target, .idea

where should you create your local git repository?
ideally you should create your repo inside your working directory i.e in this case gitproject1

Notes
one repo for one single project
no subRepos are advised




Tracking your first project

1.decide the location where to create the repository and navigate
2.initialize an empty repository  git init----> to initialize an empty repository

to delete a repo, simply delete the git. folder

3.git status--> shows u untracked files in red color
            --> shows u tracked files in green color

4. git add.-----> moves all the files to the staging area

5. git commit -m "commit message" --> sends all the files from the staging area to the local repo
6. git status after the commit shows working tree clean  becuase  we have
   all the threee stages i.e working directory , staging area and local repo synchronised


---------------------------------Some Advance git commands-------------
1. to view the files in your staging area  git ls-files
